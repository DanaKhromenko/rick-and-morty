# Rick and Morty API


### Description
On a regular basis, every day at 11:00, a web application loads data from a public API, https://rickandmortyapi.com/, 
into an internal database. The implemented API queries data from the local database. Endpoint http://localhost:8080/cartoon-characters/random returns information about a random character 
from the Rick and Morty universe. Endpoint http://localhost:8080/cartoon-characters/by-name takes a string argument 
and returns a list of all characters whose name contains the search string (example: 
http://localhost:8080/cartoon-characters/by-name?name=Morty).
